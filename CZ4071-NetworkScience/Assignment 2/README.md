# Introduction
The paper performed entity classification experimentations on the AIFB, MUTAG, BGS and AM datasets and were run on CPU nodes with 64GB of memory.

We will replicate the AIFB experiment locally with the StellarGraph Machine Learning Library's implementation of R-GCN, and perform experiments on other datasets, namely:
1. Cora
2. Citeseer

# Source Code
The source code for the implementation is done in a Python3 Notebook. To run, launch a Jupyter Notebook and run the cells. The required libraries are included in the very first section.
